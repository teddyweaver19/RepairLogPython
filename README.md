Repair Log with Data Entry Form Python
Repair log form that automatically creates and formats and excel spreadsheet if it does not already exist. Includes a timestamp feature and is a recreation of another project I did in VBA. Automates quarterly creation of a new service repair log and uses Tkinter GUI to make entry quick and easy. The documentation is thorough.
